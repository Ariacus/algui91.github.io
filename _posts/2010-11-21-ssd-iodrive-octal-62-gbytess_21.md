  <strong>The company Fusion-io has shown in its latest development SuperComputing 2010 hardware: Octal ioDrive SSD has broken all records to date in terms of speed of data transfer in SSD. We talk about rates up to 6.2 Gbytes / s, ie a Blu-ray would be transferred within four seconds, for example. But not only that but the PCIe format drive is capable of delivering up to 1 million IOPS being the highest in the market today.</strong></p> 
  
  <p>
    <strong>Fusion-io</strong> ioDrive showed in SuperComputing 2009, but this time just 8 modules integrate into a single x16 PCIe Generation 2 with a double-width slot. Octal uses ioDrive ioSphere Software Platform software solution making software / hardware and services for servers, capable of storing up to 5.7 Tbytes per card.

    In SuperComputing 2010, Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) has demonstrated the benefits of working with Fusion products. Have reported that tasks previously performed traditional hard drives are made <strong> 500 times faster </strong> with the Fusion-io technology ioDrive Octal.

    U.S. aviation organization <a href="http://www.dvhardware.net/article46622.html" target="_blank"> commented </a> a real case in which data sent from a facility in Illinois to another Maryland and later send them to New Orleans, was performed no less than <strong> 4 Gbytes/s </strong> using links 10 Gbytes/s.</div>
