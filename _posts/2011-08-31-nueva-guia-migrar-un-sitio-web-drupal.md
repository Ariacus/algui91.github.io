[![Migrating a Web Site to Drupal][1]][2]

Drupal&#8217;s advantages for running enterprise web sites are well established by such companies as FedEx, The Economist, and The White House. But many who would like to use it hesitate because they fear loss of assets now managed by their current site&#8217;s platform, or expect the procedure to transfer those assets to be prohibitively difficult.
