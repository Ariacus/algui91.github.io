This 30 page guide was written for beginners and will tell you everything you need to know about the Ubuntu experience.

Curious about Ubuntu, but not sure where to start? Start here: “Ubuntu: An Absolute Beginner’s Guide”, by author Courtney Loo, is the latest free guide from MakeUseOf and will teach you everything you need to know about Ubuntu in easy-to-understand language.

Ubuntu is a free/libre, open-source computer operating system with 20 million users worldwide. But it’s also so much more than that: it is an ethos, a collaborative project and, first and foremost, Ubuntu is a community of people.

If you’re reading this guide, you’re probably interested in moving away from proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS X; perhaps you’ve already installed Ubuntu on your computer but are not sure where to start.

Migrating to a new operating system can be daunting, especially when faced with unfamiliar words like ‘FLOSS’, ‘command line interface’ and ‘kernel’. Many people are intimidated by the technical jargon of a non-commercial operating system and believe it’s too advanced for them.

Well, that is simply not true.

Ubuntu is easy to install and simple to use. Best of all: it’s completely FREE!

This complete, free guide will teach you:

  * What Ubuntu is, in every sense of the word
  * What makes Ubuntu free, as in freedom
  * How Ubuntu and Linux are related
  * How to install Ubuntu for absolute beginners
  * Where to find free support for Ubuntu questions
  * How to use the Unity interface
  * How to find software in Ubuntu, and which software to use
