  You may have noticed the blog has been rather quiet the last couple of weeks, this is because I have been working on a project. Last month I <a target="_blank" href="http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2010/10/ubuntu-1004-e17-livedvd.html">posted details</a> about an E17 LiveDVD I was working on that was modeled after <a href="http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2010/07/pinguy-os-distro-review.html" target="_blank">PinguyOS</a>. It weighed in at a 1.4 gig download that was jam packed with every application you might ever use. It was also slightly crude in some aspects (such as the Enlightenment desktop it contained was compiled and installed from source).
</p>

<div lang="en">
  What this DVD accomplished was teaching me the ins and outs of working with Enlightenment on Ubuntu and building a remastered disc. The result? Today I would like to announce a project I have been working on with the help of a small team:
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bodhilinux.com/">Bodhi Linux</a></span></b>
</div>

<div lang="en">
  <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1i7EX7a2ELY/TOMlN1Ur4RI/AAAAAAAAAc8/5m77xf9DbnQ/s1600/logo.png"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_IlK2pNFFgGM/TOkGdJtvLGI/AAAAAAAAAFI/fvRzuxXd6jA/s1600/logo.png" alt="logo" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 94px;" border="0" /></a>
</div>

<div lang="en">
  Bodhi is a minimalistic, Linux distro that uses the Enlightenment desktop. By minimalistic I mean Bodhi comes as a 350~meg download and only includes the following pieces of software by default:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Enlightenment
    </li>
    <li>
      Firefox
    </li>
    <li>
      LXTerminal
    </li>
    <li>
      Elementary Nautilus
    </li>
    <li>
      Synaptic
    </li>
    <li>
      RemasterSYS
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div lang="en">
  The Bodhi is built from an Ubuntu 10.04 minimal disc, but you will notice it does contain some Ubuntu 10.10 features. Backported via the <a target="_blank" href="http://packages.bodhilinux.com/">Bodhi Repository</a>, are the 2.6.35 kernel and the newer Ubiquity installer. Also enabled by default are the Ubuntu partner repository, <a href="http://medibuntu.org/" target="_blank" >Medibuntu</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getdeb.net/">GetDeb</a>.
</div>

<div lang="en">
  This is the first release of Bodhi and it is of alpha quality. This is a work in progress and I am looking for feedback on what is done so far (so if you are expecting something perfect go elsewhere). As I am the only one developing the disc itself there is currently only a 32 bit version built and you can get it as a direct download from <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bodhilinux/files/bodhi_0.1.0.iso/download">here</a> (courteous of source forge). If you would like more information on the project check out our <a href="http://bodhilinux.com/about.html" target="_blank" >about page</a> or stop by <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bodhi" target="_blank" >#bodhi</a> on Freenode IRC.
</div>

  Cheers,
