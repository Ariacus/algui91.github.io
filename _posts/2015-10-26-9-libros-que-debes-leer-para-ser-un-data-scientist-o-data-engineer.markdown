>Python for Data Analysis is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python. It is also a practical, modern introduction to scientific computing in Python, tailored for data-intensive applications. This is a book about the parts of the Python language and libraries you’ll need to effectively solve a broad set of data analysis problems. This book is not an exposition on analytical methods using Python as the implementation language.

## The Human Face of Big Data

<figure>
  <img src="/images/ml/The Human Face of Big Data.jpg" title="The Human Face of Big Data" alt="The Human Face of Big Data" />
</figure>

>The images and stories captured in The Human Face of Big Data are the result of an extraordinary artistic, technical and logistical juggling act aimed at capturing the human face of the Big Data Revolution. Big Data is defined as the real time collection, analyses and visualisation of vast amounts of the information. This raw information is fuelling a revolution which many people believe may have as big an impact on humanity going forward as the Internet has over the past two decades. It enables us to sense, measure and understand aspects of our existence in ways never before possible. The Human Face of Big Data captures, in glorious photographs and moving essays, an extraordinary revolution sweeping, almost invisibly, through business, academia, government, healthcare and everyday life.

>Data Science gets thrown around in the press like it's magic. Major retailers are predicting everything from when their customers are pregnant to when they want a new pair of Chuck Taylors. It's a brave new world where seemingly meaningless data can be transformed into valuable insight to drive smart business decisions.

</figure>

>Our personal data has been used to spy on us, hire and fire us, and sell us stuff we don’t need. In Dataclysm, Christian Rudder uses it to show us who we truly are. For centuries, we’ve relied on polling or small-scale lab experiments to study human behavior. Today, a new approach is possible. As we live more of our lives online, researchers can finally observe us directly, in vast numbers, and without filters. Data scientists have become the new demographers.
