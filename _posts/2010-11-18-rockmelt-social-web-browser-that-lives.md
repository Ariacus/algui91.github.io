  There is a new web browser in town – the socially integrated, user focused <a href="http://www.rockmelt.com/" target="_blank">RockMelt</a>.
</p>



<p lang="en">
  RockMelt was build around the premise that current web browsers aren’t designed to utilise the way we use the modern web. The internet is no longer passive, but a hub of communication, interaction and sharing.
</p>

<p lang="en">
  RockMelt recently commented in a <a href="http://blog.rockmelt.com/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, <em>“With RockMelt we’ve re-thought the user experience because a browser can and should be about more than simply navigating Web pages. Today, the browser connects you to your world. Why not build your world right into your browser?”</em>
</p>

<p lang="en">
  A unique concept of RockMelt is that it lives ‘in the cloud’. This allows you to profile all of your information, bookmarks and preferences and access them all from any machine anywhere in the world.
</p>

<p lang="en">
  Another unique concept is that Facebook is used for authentication and login. The system puts big emphasis on ‘social’, with your Facebook contacts being displayed in the left bar of the browser, making it easy to quickly initiate Facebook chats or share content on their walls. On the right hand side of the browser are your bookmarks, this is where you can integrate Twitter, WordPress and all of your favourite web pages.
</p>

<p lang="en">
  The RockMelt system is built on Chromium, the same open source project behind Google’s <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome browser</a>. This will give a sense of familiarity to those who already use Chrome as well as providing the speed, stability and security required from a browser.
</p>

  RockMelt has launched into limited public beta, <a href="http://www.rockmelt.com/" target="_blank">click here</a> to try it out. For a more in depth view of RockMelt, the company has released this video demonstration for your viewing pleasure:
