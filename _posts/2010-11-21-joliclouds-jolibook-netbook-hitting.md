  Jolicloud, the self-proclaimed &#8220;perfect OS for netbooks,&#8221; has been making headlines for a while with their consumer-focused, and frankly very cute Jolibook netbook. &nbsp;Word all around the web is that it is available today in the UK.
</p>

<p lang="en">
  According to <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/11/19/first-look-at-the-jolibook-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-lightning-speed-video/">CrunchGear</a> the technical specs are as follows:&nbsp;
</p>

  * Intel Atom N550 processor (1.5 GHz, dual-core)
  * 250GB hard drive
  * 10.1â€³ screen
  * Memory: 1GB
  * Three USB 2.0 ports
  * Jacks for mic, headphones, LAN and an external monitor

<p lang="en">
  What interests us here at <em>Linux Journal</em> is that this latest netbook offering, if successful, could mark a return to Linux-based consumer netbooks. &nbsp;When Asus first debuted their <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9947">EeePC</a>, the Linux world rejoiced at the possibility of widespread consumer adoption of Linux. &nbsp;Indeed, Linux was the preferred OS of the netbook manufactures for a short time, but was predictably pushed aside with the introduction of Windows 7. &nbsp;But, as cloud computing has gone from tech conference buzzword to something my mother talks about, and as consumers rely more and more on web applications like Facebook, Google Apps and others, a product like the Jolibook could bring back some of the Linux netbook momentum.

  I have not yet tried Jolicloud&#8217;s OS, but then I am really not their primary target audience. &nbsp;Jolicloud is is presented as a hassle-free, fun, web application driven OS for everyone, and not really geared toward the power Linux user.&nbsp;
</p>

<p lang="en">
  If you&#8217;ve taken Jolicloud for a spin, let me know how it was. &nbsp;Will this be the Linux netbook for the masses?
