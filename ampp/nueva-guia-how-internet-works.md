The web’s place in our daily lives is undeniable. We can now access the Internet from our home computers, office, laptops and our phones. But even with this close intimacy many people still aren’t entirely sure what the Internet is and how it really works.

We aim to change that with this PDF guide, “How The Internet Works.” This guide, by Taty Sena, explores the hardware, software and organizations that power the modern Internet.

You’ll learn about everything from the history of the Internet to the organizations that make it possible today. You probably use the Internet every day, so educate yourself. You don’t need to know how the Internet works to use it, of course, but that doesn’t mean anyone can’t benefit from a quick overview:



  * The history of the web
  * How information is transferred
  * What DNS servers do
  * The languages of the web, including HTML, java and more
  * Current Internet trends
  * How the web changed the world

*Also with this free guide you will also receive daily updates on new cool websites and programs in your email for free courtesy of MakeUseOf.*
