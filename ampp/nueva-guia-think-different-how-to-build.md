Want to try out the Mac operating system, but don’t want to purchase Apple hardware? Check out “Think Different: How to Build Your Own Hackintosh”, the latest guide from MakeUseOf. By author Stefan Neagu, this guide outlines what you need to do in order to build a Hackintosh. Whether you want to try using a computer you already have or buy a pre-built computer for the job, this guide shows you the way.

A Hackintosh PC, as the name would suggest, is a vanilla PC (built by you or a retailer other than Apple) running a hacked (or patched) version of Apple’s Mac OS X operating system. OS X is specifically designed to run on Apple’s hardware line; a Hackintosh is simply non-Apple hardware using the operating system.

Although Apple opposes the practice of hijacking their OS for use on off-brand PCs, many technology-oriented people who don’t want to buy the hardware from Apple choose to spend a lot of time and effort in creating a Hackintosh.

It’s not easy by any means, but this guide explains to you what’s needed to get OS X running without a Mac.

This free guide shows you:

  * Where to research whether your computer can run OS X
  * Where to buy OS X compatible hardware
  * Patching OS X to install on your computer
  * Installing updates without breaking you OS X installation
  * Dual-booting Windows and OS X
  * Getting to know OS X, and finding tools to use in it
